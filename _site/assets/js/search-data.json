Abstract The linear problem $\\calL_M$ for a matrix $M\\in\\F^{n\\times n}$ asks one to compute $Mx$ for a given vector $x\\in\\F^n$. Given an average-case solver $\\calO$ for $\\calL_M$ such that \\[ \\Pr_{x\\sim\\F^n}[\\calO(x)=Mx]\\ge\\varepsilon, \\] can we solve $\\calL_M$ correctly on every input with almost the same running time? . This paper presents both positive and negative results on worst-case-to-average-case reductions for this problem. | First, we present a surprisingly simple worst-case-to-average-case nonuniform reduction that uses $\\Theta(n)$ bits of advice. | Second, if the field size satisfies $p=|\\F|&gt;1/\\varepsilon+1$, then there exists a uniform worst-case-to-average-case reduction. | Third, if the field size satisfies $p=|\\F|\\le1/\\varepsilon$, then any worst-case-to-average-case reduction requires $\\Omega(\\log_p(1/\\varepsilon)\\cdot\\log n)$ bits of advice. Moreover, this lower bound is tight: there exists a worst-case-to-average-case reduction that uses $O(\\log_p(1/\\varepsilon)\\cdot\\log n)$ bits of advice. | . Hardness Amplification Beyond Boolean Functions Nobutaka Shimizu, Kenji Yasunaga Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2026) Average-Case Complexity . Abstract We prove an XOR lemma for $\\F_p$-valued functions for every prime $p$, using the characterization of weak hardness in terms of pseudo min-average entropy (PAME) due to Zheng (2014) and Vadhan and Zheng (2012). Specifically, if $f\\colon\\{0,1\\}^n\\to\\F_p$ is hard to compute on more than a $(1+\\varepsilon)/p$ fraction of instances for any circuit of size $s$, then \\[ f^{+k}\\colon (x_1,\\dots,x_k)\\mapsto f(x_1)+\\dots+f(x_k) \\] is hard to compute on more than a $(1-\\delta)$ fraction of instances for circuits of size $\\Omega\\!\\left(s\\cdot\\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{pk^2\\log(k/\\varepsilon)}\\right)$, where $k=O(p^2\\log(p/\\varepsilon)/\\delta)$. As an application, we present an error-tolerant worst-case-to-average-case nonuniform reduction for triangle counting over Erdős–Rényi graphs. We also prove a query lower bound for adaptive black-box hardness amplification for $\\F_p$-valued functions. This lower bound does not match the upper bound achieved by our XOR-lemma reduction. It is obtained via the framework of Shaltiel and Viola (2010) and Grinberg, Shaltiel, and Viola (2018) by considering a coin problem over $\\F_p$. We also present a conceptually simpler proof of the fixed-set lemma using KL-divergence. 3-Majority and 2-Choices with Many Opinions Nobutaka Shimizu, Takeharu Shiraga Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC 2025) DOI:10.1145/3732772.3733511 | arXiv:2503.02426 Graph Theory Consensus Dynamics Stochastic Processes . Abstract This paper presents the first tight bound on the consensus time of 3-Majority and 2-Choices with an arbitrary number of opinions in the parallel gossip model, resolving our seven-year-old private open problem. The proof relies on multi-step concentration via the Freedman inequality framework developed in our SODA’25 paper. The main technical challenge is that, in the gossip model, all vertices simultaneously update their opinions. As a result, we cannot exploit the locality of updates from the sequential model, which was crucial in our SODA’25 analysis (in martingale terms, the bounded-jump condition is no longer applicable). We overcome this difficulty by observing that, in each round, all vertices independently choose their next opinion. This observation leads us to introduce the notion of a Bernstein condition, which allows us to transfer concentration bounds from the sequential model to the parallel gossip model. An Optimal Error-Correcting Reduction for Matrix Multiplication Shuichi Hirahara, Nobutaka Shimizu International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2025) DOI: 10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2025.97 | Slide | ECCC Average-Case Complexity Error-Correcting Code . Abstract This paper is a follow-up to our STOC’25 paper below, which presents a uniform worst-case-to-average-case and exact-to-approximation reduction for matrix multiplication. Specifically, we show that there exists a randomized oracle algorithm $M^{\\calO}$ such that, for any oracle $\\calO$ satisfying \\[ \\Pr_{\\substack{A,B\\sim\\F^{n\\times n} \\\\ i,j\\sim[n]}}[\\calO(A,B)_{i,j} = (AB)_{i,j}] \\ge \\frac{1}{|\\F|}+\\varepsilon, \\] the algorithm $M^{\\calO}$ satisfies \\[ \\forall A,B\\in\\F^{n\\times n}, \\quad \\Pr_{M^{\\calO}}[M^{\\calO}(A,B)=AB] \\ge \\frac{2}{3}. \\] This oracle algorithm makes only $\\Otilde(1)$ queries. The key idea is to encode matrix multiplication using derandomized direct sum over expander walks, and then apply a recent linear-time approximate list-decoding algorithm for this code due to Jeronimo (2023). Error-Correction of Matrix Multiplication Algorithms Shuichi Hirahara, Nobutaka Shimizu Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025) DOI: 10.1145/3717823.3718244 | ECCC | Slide Average-Case Complexity Error-Correcting Code . Abstract Given an efficient algorithm $\\calO$ that computes an $\\alpha$ fraction of the entries of $AB$ for two uniformly random matrices $A,B\\sim\\F^{n\\times n}$, can we design an efficient algorithm that computes all entries of $AB$? . We answer this question affirmatively when $|\\F|\\ge n/\\alpha^2$. Specifically, there exists a randomized oracle algorithm $M^{\\calO}$ such that, for any oracle $\\calO$ satisfying \\[ \\Pr_{\\substack{A,B\\sim\\F^{n\\times n} \\\\ i,j\\sim[n]}}[\\calO(A,B)_{i,j} = (AB)_{i,j}] \\ge \\alpha, \\] the algorithm $M^{\\calO}$ satisfies \\[ \\forall A,B\\in\\F^{n\\times n}, \\quad \\Pr_{M^{\\calO}}[M^{\\calO}(A,B)=AB] \\ge \\frac{2}{3}. \\] Moreover, if $\\calO$ runs in time $T(n)$, then $M^{\\calO}$ runs in time $\\Otilde(T(n)\\cdot\\log|\\F|\\cdot\\log(1/\\alpha))$. We also consider the case where the field size $|\\F|$ is constant. We present a nonuniform reduction when $\\alpha&gt;1/|\\F|+\\varepsilon$ (note that outputting a random matrix achieves $\\alpha=1/|\\F|$, so this bound is nearly tight), and a uniform reduction when $\\alpha&gt;2/|\\F|+\\varepsilon$. The key idea is to encode matrices using a linear tensor code. Such a code encodes a matrix $C\\in\\F^{n\\times n}$ as \\[ LCL^\\top \\in \\F^{N\\times N}, \\] for a carefully designed matrix $L\\in\\F^{N\\times n}$. Under this encoding, the product $AB$ is mapped to $LABL^\\top$, and we obtain a noisy codeword $\\widetilde{C}$ that is close to $LABL^\\top$ by running the approximation solver on the inputs \\[ LA \\text{ and } BL^\\top. \\] . Asynchronous 3-Majority Dynamics with Many Opinions Colin Cooper, Frederik Mallmann-Trenn, Tomasz Radzik, Nobutaka Shimizu, Takeharu Shiraga Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2025) DOI: 10.1137/1.9781611978322.140 | arXiv:2503.02426 | Slide Graph Theory Consensus Dynamics Stochastic Processes . Abstract This paper bounds the consensus time of 3-Majority in the sequential update model (i.e., at each round, only one randomly chosen vertex updates its opinion), where each vertex holds an opinion from the set $\\{1,\\dots,k\\}$. We prove that the consensus time is $\\Otilde(\\min(k,\\sqrt{n}))$ with high probability for any $2\\le k\\le n$, using Freedman’s inequality (a Bernstein-type concentration inequality for martingales). Planted Clique Conjectures Are Equivalent Shuichi Hirahara, Nobutaka Shimizu Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2024) DOI: 10.1145/3618260.3649751 | ECCC | Slide Average-Case Complexity Graph Theory . Abstract We study the hardness self-amplification problem for planted clique, for both the search and decision versions. For example, we show that if we can find an $n^{1/2-\\alpha}$-clique hidden in the Erdős–Rényi graph $G(n,1/2)$ with success probability $\\varepsilon$ in polynomial time, then we can find an $n^{1/2-\\alpha-o(1)}$-clique in $G(n,1/2)$ in polynomial time. As a corollary, we present the first search-to-decision reduction for the planted clique problem in a high-error regime, meaning that any algorithm that decides planted clique with a small advantage can be transformed into a search algorithm with a large success probability. The core idea of our reductions is to embed an instance of planted clique into a slightly larger Erdős–Rényi random graph and then shrink the graph by taking a random induced subgraph. Correctness follows from the sampler property, via a read-$k$ concentration inequality due to Gavinsky, Lovett, Saks, and Srinivasan (2015). Hardness Self-Amplification: Simplified, Optimized, and Unified Shuichi Hirahara, Nobutaka Shimizu Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2023) DOI: 10.1145/3564246.3585189 | ECCC | Slide Average-Case Complexity . Abstract Hardness amplification is a general technique for turning a problem $\\Pi$ that is only weakly hard on average into one that is hard on average with high probability. In hardness self-amplification, the goal is more ambitious: the amplified problem $\\Pi'$ is required to be identical to the original problem $\\Pi$, unlike classical approaches such as the direct product theorem or the XOR lemma, which inherently modify the problem. I proved such self-amplification results for several natural computational problems, including matrix multiplication, triangle counting modulo $2$, and the planted clique problem. The unifying idea behind these results is upward self-reduction, which embeds a given instance into a slightly larger random instance. Correctness follows from the fact that the reduction exhibits a sampler property of the bipartite graph specified this embedding. As a particularly simple example, I obtained an error-tolerant worst-case-to-average-case reduction for matrix multiplication based on the direct product theorem. Despite its simplicity, this reduction already captures many of the key ideas behind self-amplification and remains one of my favorite constructions. Hardness Self-Amplification from Feasible Hard-Core Sets Shuichi Hirahara, Nobutaka Shimizu Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 2022) DOI: 10.1109/FOCS54457.2022.00083 | ECCC | Slide Average-Case Complexity . Abstract under construction Nearly Optimal Average-Case Complexity of Counting Bicliques Under SETH Shuichi Hirahara, Nobutaka Shimizu Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2021) DOI: 10.1137/1.9781611976465.140 | arXiv:2010.05822 | Slide Average-Case Complexity Graph Theory . Abstract We prove an error-tolerant worst-case-to-average-case reduction for computing the parity of the biclique-counting problem on a random bipartite graph, and we also show that this problem is SETH-hard. A key observation is that the worst-case-to-average-case reduction of Boix-Adserà, Brennan, and Bresler (2021) for the clique-counting problem extends naturally to general (colorful) subgraph-counting problems. We then apply an XOR lemma to make the reduction error-tolerant. The main technical ingredient is to design a doubly efficient interactive proof system for subgraph counting in order to eliminate the nonuniform advice required by the XOR lemma. How Many Vertices Does a Random Walk Miss in a Network with Moderately Increasing the Number of Vertices? Shuji Kijima, Nobutaka Shimizu, Takeharu Shiraga Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2021) DOI: 10.1137/1.9781611976465.8 | arXiv:2008.10837 | Slide Graph Theory Random Walks . Abstract We consider a random walk on a sequence of graphs $\\calG=(G_i)_{i=0,1,\\dots}$ whose vertex set grows over time. Specifically, for each $i=0,1,\\dots$, we perform a $t(i)$-step random walk on $G_i$ and investigate the number $U$ of unvisited vertices for complete graphs and path graphs. We also prove that if $t(i)$ is sufficiently large compared to the mixing time of $G_i$, then $U$ is small. Quasi-majority Functional Voting on Expander Graphs Nobutaka Shimizu, Takeharu Shiraga International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2020) DOI: 10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2020.97 | arXiv:2002.07411 Graph Theory Consensus Dynamics Stochastic Processes Expander . Abstract We introduce the notion of quasi-majority functional voting, which is a broad class of consensus dynamics including 3-Majority and 2-Choices, and we bound the consensus time on expander graphs. Phase Transitions of Best-of-Two and Best-of-Three on Stochastic Block Models Nobutaka Shimizu, Takeharu Shiraga International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC 2019) DOI: 10.4230/LIPIcs.DISC.2019.32 | arXiv:1907.12212 Graph Theory Consensus Dynamics Stochastic Processes . Abstract We consider 3-Majority and 2-Choices (in the synchronous gossip model) on a stochastic block model $G(n,p,q)$. We show that there exists a threshold $\\theta\\in(0,1)$ such that . | if $q/p&gt;\\theta$, then the dynamics converges to consensus within $O(\\log n)$ rounds. | if $q/p&lt;\\theta$, then there exists an initial configuration such that the consensus time is exponentially large. | . The Diameter of Dense Random Regular Graphs Nobutaka Shimizu Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2018) DOI: 10.1137/1.9781611975031.126 Graph Theory Random Graphs . Abstract We prove that the diameter of a random regular graph $G_{n,d}$ for $d = n^{\\alpha}$ is $\\lfloor \\alpha^{-1} \\rfloor+1$ by first-order and second-order methods. The main technical difficulty is to evaluate the second moment of the number of $st$-paths (for fixed $s,t$).
