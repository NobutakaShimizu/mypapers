    "content": "In Planted Clique Problem, we are given a random graph obtained by the following procedure: . Sample a graph $G$ from the Erdős-Rényi model $G(n, 1/2)$ with $n$ vertices. Then, choose a set of $k$ vertices $C\\subseteq [n]$ uniformly at random and add edges between all pairs of vertices in $C$, making $C$ a $k$-clique in $G$. The distribution of the resulting graph is denoted as $\\PC(n, k)$. The goal is to find the planted clique $C$ given a graph drawn from $\\PC(n,k)$. The complexity of finding the planted clique in a graph drawn from $\\PC(n,k)$ crucially depends on the size $k$ of the planted clique. | It is well known that the maximum clique in a random graph $G\\sim G(n,1/2)$ is of size $(2+o(1))\\log_2 n$ with high probability. Thus, if $k\\le 2\\log_2 n$, then we cannot find $C$. | On the other hand, if $k\\gg 2\\log_2 n$, we can find $C$ with high probability by the brute-force search over all $k$-cliques in $G$. | . Therefore, the threshold $k=2\\log_2 n$ is the information-theoretic limit for solvability of the planted clique problem. However, the brute-force search for $k\\gg2\\log_2 n$ is not efficient. So the natural question is: . Can we find the planted clique $C$ given $G\\sim\\PC(n,k)$ when $k\\gg 2\\log_2 n$? . This question was initially studied by Jerrum[1] and Kučera[2]. Jerrum[1] proved that a class of algorithms based on Metropolis process cannot find the planted clique when $k\\ll \\sqrt{n}$. Kučera[2] showed that if $k\\ge c\\sqrt{n\\log n}$ for a sufficiently large constant $c&gt;0$, then vertices with top-$k$ largest degrees in $G$ form the planted clique $C$ with high probability. In a seminal work, Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov[3] presented a polynomial-time algorithm that finds the planted clique with high probability when $k\\ge c\\sqrt{n}$ for an arbitrary constant $c&gt;0$. Despite a long line of research from 1990s, no polynomial-time algorithm is known for Planted Clique Problem for $k\\ll \\sqrt{n}$. Moreover, several works have shown that Planted Clique Problem with $k\\ll \\sqrt{n}$ is hard against various natural classes of algorithms, including Lovász–Schrijver semidefinite programming hierarchy[4], sum-of-squares hierarchy[5], statistical query algorithms[6], and constant depth circuits[7]. This raises the conjecture asserting the hardness of Planted Clique Problem for $k\\ll \\sqrt{n}$. Conjecture 1(Planted Clique Conjecture) . There exists a constant $\\alpha&gt;0$ such that for $k = n^{1/2-\\alpha}$, no polynomial-time algorithm can find the planted clique $C$ from $G\\sim\\PC(n,k)$ with probability $2/3$, where the probability is taken over the choice of $G$. Assuming Conjecture 1, we can see that Planted Clique Problem exhibits a computational-statistical gap: The information-theoretical threshold is $k=2\\log_2 n$, whereas the computational threshold is $k=\\sqrt{n}$. This kind of gap appears in a variety of problems in high-dimensional statistical inference. ",

    "content": "Why do we care about the hardness of Planted Clique Problem? For computational complexity theorists, Planted Clique Problem can be seen as a natural average-case problem that is conjectured to be hard. Moreover, this problem can be seen as the average-case variant of the maximum clique problem, which is a well-known NP-hard problem. In the area of high-dimensional statistics, Planted Clique Conjecture serves as a hypothetical hardness assumption for various statistical inference problems, including community detection[8], sparse PCA[9], and approximate Nash Equilibria[10], to name a few. Assuming Planted Clique Conjecture, we can prove computational lower bounds for these problems. Interestingly, based on Planted Clique Conjecture, we can construct a one-way function, a fundamental building block of cryptography [11]. Roughly speaking, a one-way function is a function $f$ that can be easy to compute $f(x)$ given $x$ but hard to invert $x$ for given $f(x)$ for random $x$. For example, consider a function $f(G,C)$ that outputs the graph obtained by making $C$ a clique in $G$, which is easy to compute given $G$ and $C$. If $G$ is drawn from $G(n,1/2)$ and $C$ is a random $k$-vertex set, then distribution of $f(G,C)$ coincides with $\\PC(n,k)$. Thus, assuming Planted Clique Conjecture, it is hard to invert $f(G,C)$ for random $G$ and $C$. A variant of Planted Clique Problem is shown to be useful in the context of secret sharing[12] and public-key cryptography[13]. ",

    "content": "In my STOC’24 paper with Shuichi [14], we show that several variant of Planted Clique Conjectures are equivalent. The variants are as follows: . | Decision version: In the decision version of Planted Clique Problem, our task is to distinguish two distributions: $\\PC(n,k)$ and $G(n,1/2)$. Specifically, we are given a graph $G$ that is drawn from either $\\PC(n,k)$ or $G(n,1/2)$, and we are asked to decide which distribution from which $G$ is drawn. We say that an algorithm $A$ has advantage $\\beta$ if . \\[\\begin{align*} \\left|\\Pr_{G\\sim\\PC(n,k)}[A(G)=1] - \\Pr_{G\\sim G(n,1/2)}[A(G)=1]\\right| \\geq \\beta. \\end{align*}\\] Our goal is to design an algorithm with as high advantage as possible. | Search version: In the search version of Planted Clique Problem, we are given a graph $G$ that is drawn from $\\PC(n,k)$, and our task is to find the planted clique $C$ (this coincides with the definition above). We say that an algorithm $A$ has success probability $\\beta$ if . \\[\\begin{align*} \\Pr_{G\\sim\\PC(n,k)}[A(G)=C] \\geq \\beta, \\end{align*}\\] where $C$ denotes the planted clique in $G$. Conjecture 1 says that any polynomial-time algorithm has success probability at most $2/3$ for $k=n^{1/2-\\alpha}$. | . In view of this, the formal statement of “Planted Clique Conjecture” relies on . | whether we care about the decision version or search version, and | the choice of the parameter $\\beta$ (the success probability or advantage). | . In our paper [14], we show that the choice above (decision or search, and the choice of $\\beta$) does not matter for a wide range of $\\beta$. Roughly speaking, we show that . If one can distinguish $\\PC(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha})$ and $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $\\Omega(1)$ for some $\\alpha&gt;0$, then one can find the planted clique $C$ from $\\PC(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha’})$ with success probability $1-\\exp(-n^{\\Omega(1)})$ for some $\\alpha’&gt;0$. Below is the precise statement of our result. Theorem 2 (informal) . The following statements are equivalent: . | There exist a constant $\\alpha&gt;0$ and a polynomial-time algorithm $A$ that finds the planted clique $C$ from $G\\sim\\PC(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha})$ with probability $2/3$. | There exist constants $\\alpha,\\gamma&gt;0$ and a polynomial-time algorithm $A$ that finds the planted clique $C$ from $G\\sim\\PC(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha})$ with probability $1-\\exp(-n^\\gamma)$. | There exist constants $\\alpha,\\gamma&gt;0$ and a polynomial-time algorithm $A$ that finds the planted clique $C$ from $G\\sim\\PC(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha})$ with success probability $1/n^\\gamma$. | There exist a constant $\\alpha&gt;0$ and a polynomial-time algorithm $A$ that distinguishes $\\PC(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha})$ from $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $1/3$. | There exist constants $\\alpha,\\gamma&gt;0$ and a polynomial-time algorithm $A$ that distinguishes $\\PC(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha})$ from $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $1-\\exp(-n^\\gamma)$. | There exist constants $\\alpha,\\gamma&gt;0$ and a polynomial-time algorithm $A$ that distinguishes $\\widetilde{\\PC}(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha})$ from $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $k^{2+\\gamma}/n$. | . Here, the distribution $\\widetilde{\\PC}(n,k)$ is called binomial-$k$ model, defined as the distribution of the following random graph: Sample $G\\sim G(n,1/2)$ and let $C\\subseteq [n]$ be a random subset that contains each vertex with probability $k/n$ independently. Then, add edges between all pairs of vertices in $C$, making $C$ a clique in $G$. The first three statements says that the choice of the success probability $\\beta$ does not matter for the search version of Planted Clique Conjecture for any $1/\\poly(n) \\le \\beta \\le 1-\\exp(-\\poly(n))$. Similarly, the last three statements say that the choice of the advantage $\\beta$ does not matter for the decision version of Planted Clique Conjecture as long as $k^{2+\\gamma}/n \\le \\beta \\le 1-\\exp(-\\poly(n)) $. In the binomial-$k$ model, the size of the planted clique is random with mean $k$. But the Chernoff bound yields that the clique size is concentrated around $k$ with high probability. So these two models (binomial-$k$ and fixed-$k$) are essentially equivalent (but I don’t know how to prove that). As an immediate but interesting corollary, we can obtain the following statement: . Corollary 3 (informal) . If there is a polynomial-time algorithm that distinguishes $\\widetilde{\\PC}(n,k)$ and $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $k^{2+\\gamma}/n$ for some constant $\\gamma&gt;0$, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds the planted clique for a graph drawn from $\\PC(n,n^{1/2-\\alpha’})$ with advantage $1-\\exp(-n^{\\gamma’})$ for some constants $\\alpha’,\\gamma’&gt;0$. Indeed, by counting the number of edges, we can distinguish $\\widetilde{\\PC}(n,k)$ with $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $\\Omega(k^/n)$ (see, e.g., Luca’s blog). Therefore, Corollary 3 implies that assuming Planted Clique Conjecture, the edge counting algorithm is almost optimal for the decision version of Planted Clique Problem. Corollary 3 improves the search-to-decision reduction by Alon et al.[15]. Informally speaking, they showed how to reduce finding the planted clique in $\\PC(n,k)$ to distinguishing $\\PC(n,k)$ and $G(n,1/2)$ with advantage $1-o(n)$. Later work: A very recent paper [16] further closed the gap between $k^{2+\\gamma}/n$ and $k^2/n$ using a more sophisticated analysis. Actually, they showed that assuming Conjecture 1, a low-degree algorithm achieves an optimal advantage for the decision version of Planted Clique Problem. ",

    "title": "Techniques",
    "content": "The key ingredient in our proof is two kinds of reductions: embedding reduction and shrinking reduction. These reductions are aimed to boost the advantage or success probability of an algorithm. Embedding Reduction . This reduction is introduced in our previous work [17]. The idea is to randomly embed the planted clique $C$ into a larger Erdős–Rényi graph $G(N,1/2)$. Note that the distribution of the resulting graph is identical to $\\PC(N,k)$. If we set $N = n^{1+o(1)}$ and $k = n^{1/2-\\alpha}$, then the size of the planted clique $C$ is $k = n^{1/2-\\alpha} = N^{1/2-\\alpha-o(1)}$. Let $\\calO$ be an algorithm that finds the planted clique in $G(N,k)$ with small success probability. Consider the following oracle algorithm $A^{\\calO}$: . Algorithm $A_{\\mathrm{emd}}^{\\calO}(G,N)$. Let $G\\sim\\PC(n,k)$ be the input and $N$ is a parameter. | Obtain $G’$ by the embedding reduction above. | If $\\calO(G’)$ is a $k$-clique $C’$, then, we can find the original clique and output it. | Repeat 1-2 for $\\poly(n)$ times. If we cannot find a $k$-clique, then output “failure”. | . Using this, we can boost the success probability of $\\calO$ as follows: . Theorem 4 (Theorem 6.8 in the full version) . Suppose that $\\calO$ finds the planted clique in $G(N,k)$ with success probability $\\varepsilon$ and let $\\delta&gt;0$ be any parameter. If $N$ satisfies $N\\ge n\\cdot \\log(1/\\varepsilon)/\\delta^2$, then the oracle algorithm $A^{\\calO}_{\\mathrm{emb}}(G,N)$ finds the planted clique in $G(n,k)$ with success probability $1-\\delta$. If we set $\\varepsilon = 1/\\poly(n)$ and $\\delta=1/3$, we can say that the oracle algorithm $A^{\\calO}_{\\mathrm{emb}}(G,N)$ finds the planted clique in $G(n,k)$ with success probability $2/3$ given an oracle $\\calO$ that finds the planted clique in $G(N,k)$ with success probability $1/\\poly(n)$. This implies Item 3 $\\Rightarrow$ Item 1 in Theorem 2. A similar boosting result also holds for the decision version, where we boost the advantage by taking the majority of the answers. Algorithm $D_{\\mathrm{emd}}^{\\calO}(G,N)$. Let $G$ be the input $n$-vertex vector and $N$ is a parameter. | Obtain $G’$ by the embedding reduction above. | Let $b\\leftarrow \\calO(G’)$. | Repeat 1-2 for $\\poly(n)$ times and output the majority of the answers $b$. | . Theorem 5 (Theorem 6.9 in the full version) . Suppose that $\\calO$ distinguishes $\\PC(N,k)$ and $G(N,k)$ with advantage $\\varepsilon$ and let $\\delta&gt;0$ be any parameter. If $N$ satisfies $N\\ge n\\cdot \\log(1/\\varepsilon)/(\\delta^2\\varepsilon^2)$, then the oracle algorithm $A^{\\calO}_{\\mathrm{emb}}(G,N)$ finds the planted clique in $G(n,k)$ with success probability $1-\\delta$. Unfortunately, we cannot set $\\varepsilon=1/\\poly(n)$ here (for example, if we set $\\varepsilon=1/n$, then we would have $N=n^3$, which is too big). Shrinking Reduction . The main drawback of the embedding reduction is that we cannot set $\\delta$ to be small. This is because the size of the large graph is $N\\ge 1/\\delta^2$. In order to deal with small $\\delta$, we shall use a different reduction called shrinking reduction. The reduction is very simple: Given an $M$-vertex graph, choose $m&lt;M$ distinct vertices randomly and take the subgraph induced by these vertices. Let $G$ be the original graph and $G’$ be the resulting graph. If $G$ is drawn from $G(M,1/2)$, then the distribution of $G’$ is $G(m,1/2)$. On the other hand, if $G$ is drawn from $\\PC(M,k)$ with planted clique $C\\subseteq[M]$, then the distribution of $G’$ is $\\PC(m,k’)$, where $k’$ is the number of vertices in the planted clique included in the vertices of $G’$. More precisely, let $S\\subseteq[M]$ be set of the chosen $m$ vertices in this reduction and $C\\subseteq[M]$ be the planted clique. Then, the resulting graph has clique of size $k’=\\abs{S\\cap C}$. Note that $k’$ is a random variable. The distribution of $k’$ is identical to the hypergeometric distribution with mean $\\frac{m}{M}k$. Actually, this distribution is statistically close to the binomial distribution $\\mathrm{Bin}(m,k/M)$. Conditioned on $k’$ the distribution of $G’$ is precisely $\\PC(m,k’)$. Therefore, the resulting graph has a clique of size (statistically close to) $\\mathrm{Bin}(m,k/M)$, meaning that the graph is statistically close to $\\widetilde{\\PC}(n,k)$. Likewise as the embedding reduction, we can boost the success probability or advantage of an algorithm using this reduction. In the following, we focus on the decision version. Algorithm $D_{\\mathrm{shr}}^{\\calO}(G,m)$. Let $G$ be the graph over $M$ vertices and $m$ is a parameter. | Choose $m$ vertices uniformly at random from $G$ and let $G’$ be the subgraph induced by $m$. | Output $\\pi(G’)$, where $\\pi\\colon[m]\\to[m]$ is a random permutation. | Let $b\\leftarrow\\calO(G’)$. | Repeat 1-3 for $\\poly(m)$ times and output the majority of the answers $b$. | . Theorem 6 (Theorem 6.9 in the full version) . Let $\\calO$ be an algorithm that distinguishes $\\widetilde{\\PC}(m,k’)$ and $G(m,1/2)$ with advantage $\\varepsilon$, where $k’=(m/M)\\cdot k$. For any $\\delta&gt;0$, let $m$ be a parameter such that $m\\le M\\cdot \\varepsilon / \\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)}$. Then, the algorithm $A^{\\calO}_{\\mathrm{shr}}(G,m)$ distinguishes $\\PC(M,k)$ and $G(M,1/2)$ with advantage $1-\\delta$. The key point is that the parameter $m$ depends logarithmically on $1/\\delta$, which enables us to set $\\delta = \\exp(-M^{o(1)})$. On the other hand, $m$ depends polynomially on $1/\\varepsilon$. So we need $\\varepsilon = M^{-o(1)}$. Fortunately, we can deal with this case thanks to the embedding reduction! . Although $\\PC(n,k)$ and $\\widetilde{\\PC}(n,k)$ are very similar, we are not aware of any computational equivalence between them. But we can prove reduce search problem over $\\widetilde{\\PC}(m,1.1k)$ to the search problem over $\\PC(m,k)$ with a cost of success probability. Lemma 7 (Modification of Lemma 5.7 in the full version) . Let $k=\\omega(\\log m)$. If there is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds the planted clique in $\\PC(m,k)$ with success probability $1-\\delta$, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds the planted clique in $\\widetilde{\\PC}(m,1.1k)$ with success probability $1-m\\delta-m^{-\\omega(1)}$. Proof sketch. Let $\\calO$ be the algorithm that finds the planted clique in $\\PC(m,k)$ with success probability $1-\\delta$. Let $G\\sim\\widetilde{\\PC}(m,1.1k)$ be the input. Since the distribution of the planted clique size is $\\mathrm{Bin}(m,1.1k/m)$, the Hoeffding bound implies that the clique size is at least $k$ with probability $1-m^{-\\omega(1)}$. The idea of the reduction is simple: Let $v_1,\\dots,v_m$ be the vertices of $G$. For each $i\\in[m]$, let $G_i$ be the graph obtained by resampling edges touching ${v_1,\\dots,v_i}$. Run the oracle $\\calO$ on each $G_i$. If the oracle finds a $k$-clique in $G_i$, then it is a subclique of the planted clique $C$ in $G$ (with high probability). So we can recover the whole clique in $G$. In $G_i$, the size of the planted clique is $k - \\abs{\\qty{v_1,\\dots,v_i}\\cap C}$. Therefore, the clique size decreases by at most 1 for each $i$. For some $j$, the marginal distribution of $G_{j}$ is $\\PC(m,k)$ and the algorithm $\\calO$ finds the planted clique in $G_{j}$ with success probability $1-\\delta$. By the union bound over $i$, the total success probability is at least $1-m\\delta$. $\\square$ . Unfortunately, we are not aware of how to prove a analogous lemma for the decision version. ",
